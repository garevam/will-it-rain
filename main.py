WIP

This program is to be the backbone of a little web service. It should take a location and a date range and access
open-meteo's API to retrieve the last 50 years of weather data for that location and date range. Then, it will provide
information to a dashboard to present the user some statistics:
-average precipitation pattern over the average year,
-average yearly precipitation pattern from 1970-1975 compared to 2017-2022,
-a graph showing the amount of precipitation every year on that specific date range and finally
-a simple % chance of rain for the desired date in a future year

The dashboard itself is a problem for the future, likely better made with wev dev languages.

Made with Python 3.11
